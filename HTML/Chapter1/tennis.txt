Tennis is a sport usually played between two players (singles) or between
two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a racket that is 
strung to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over a net into the
 opponent's court. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels 
of society at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a 
racket, including people in wheelchairs.
