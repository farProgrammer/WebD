Football may refer to one of a number of team sports which all involve, 
to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. 
The most popular of these sports worldwide is association football, 
more commonly known as just "football" or "soccer". Unqualified, 
the word football applies to whichever form of football is the most 
popular in the regional context in which the word appears, including 
American football, Australian rules football, Canadian football, 
Gaelic football, rugby league, rugby union and other related games. 
These variations of football are known as football "codes".
